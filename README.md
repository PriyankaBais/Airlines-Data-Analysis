<b>✈️ Airline Occupancy Rate Optimization Using SQL</b><br><br>

<b>📂 Project Overview:</b><br>
The goal of this project is to analyze airline operational data using SQL and Python to identify opportunities to improve flight occupancy on underperforming routes, which can lead to increased profitability.<br><br>

<b>🗃️ Tools & Technologies:</b><br>
<b>SQL</b> – Data querying and analysis<br>
<b>Pandas</b> – Data manipulation<br>
<b>Matplotlib & Seaborn</b> – Data visualization<br>
<b>SQLite</b> – Database used for querying<br><br>

<b>🛫 Dataset Source:</b><br>
The data was obtained from a travel airline SQLite database containing detailed tables like flights, bookings, boarding passes, aircrafts, tickets, etc.<br><br>

<b>🔍 Key Explorations & Insights:</b><br>
<b>• Planes with >100 seats:</b> Identified aircrafts with high seating capacity for targeted occupancy improvements.<br>
<b>• Ticket trends over time:</b> Visualized daily ticket booking volume and total revenue earned over time.<br>
<b>• Average ticket charges:</b> Calculated average revenue per ticket across aircraft and fare types.<br>
<b>• Revenue insights:</b> Estimated total revenue and per-ticket average for each aircraft model.<br>
<b>• Occupancy Rate Analysis:</b> Measured average seat occupancy per aircraft and identified improvement areas.<br>
<b>• Revenue Forecasting:</b> Simulated a 10% increase in occupancy to predict its impact on annual turnover.<br><br>

<b>📈 Results:</b><br>
Significant revenue uplift is possible by improving the occupancy rate by just 10% across aircraft types.<br>
Example: Aircraft model 773 could increase turnover from ₹343 crore to ₹377 crore annually.<br><br>

<b>💡 Conclusion:</b><br>
Improving the occupancy rate of under-utilized flights is a viable strategy for airlines to boost profitability.<br><br>
